Many of you are probably familiar with R & RStudio.

Example Application
=======================================================

- Julia's PSP work 
- This presentation
- My Integrated Report work
- Dan's basin-specific scripts

TMDL scripts
=======================================================
- Scripts for individual TMDL projects organized by folder

- Data and other large files reside in folders outside the R project

Getting Started in Our Group
=======================================================

- Provide steps to set up GitHub and RStudio to group
- Peter and Dan will provide help
  - Have developed a start-up word document
  - They will do this during the initial stage of our use of GitHub
  - They will only help with use and setup problems with using GiHub through RStudio
  - We will all be able to help each other as our proficiency with GitHub increases
